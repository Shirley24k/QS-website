                <p>The Metadiscourse Awareness Test has gone through stringent validity and reliability test results and therefore, it is a valid instrument to be used in future research. This test could be commercialised as a reference for all writing genres to determine the latent awareness of metadiscourse use by writers.</p>

                <p>The constructed texts with and without metadiscourse could be commercialised as a guide to aid writing instructors to use authentic texts for teaching metadiscourse use in writing classroom.</p>

                <p>The writing prompts could be commercialised as a guideline for the writers to know the functions of metadiscourse in order to prepare them for real experience of language in any sort of setting on how far they can engage the readers in authentic interpretation, interaction and communication.</p>
